 Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out the distribution by hour of the day for each of the messages. You can pull the hour out from the 'From ' line by finding the time and then splitting the string a second time using a colon.

Once you have accumulated the counts for each hour, print out the counts, sorted by hour as shown below.

* DATA IS TAKEN FROM "mbox-short.txt" file*
code:- /This is my own code written /
name = input("Enter file:")
if len(name) < 1 : name = "mbox-short.txt"
handle = open(name)
lst = list()
lst_2 = list()
dat = dict()
for line in handle:
	lx = line.rstrip()
	if not lx.startswith('From '):
		continue
	time = lx.split()
	lst.append(time[5])
#untill here all the time values will be saved in a list e.g: 09:14:16 and so on
for first in lst:
	hr = first[:2]
	lst_2.append(hr)
#untill here we are just taking the first two character in the time
for i in lst_2:
	dat[i] = dat.get(i,0) + 1
#here we are creating a histogram or simply, creating the number of dates repeated
asd = list()

for k,v in dat.items():
	newt = (k,v)
	asd.append(newt)
#as we cannot sort dictionaries, we are converting them into tuples only for sorting

asd = sorted(asd)
#this is the sorted list of tuples
for v,k in asd:
	print(v,k)
